# AV-Loan-Prediction

Tried to enter the Loan Prediction competition using tidymodels in R.

##Learnings:
1. I fared in the top1000 (886) out of 69K participants which is good start.
2. Tidymodels provides an interface like pipeline in Python.
3. Not too much feature engineering but adding log transformation, pca, dummy encoding is all in 1 line of code
4. Ensembling logistic regression and random forest produced better result than XGBoost
